# Write an program that takes in a user’s name and appropriately outputs their name in the song ‘Happy Birthday’
# This will require variables, input and print statements




# Using the first program, create a function that outputs the same song when the function is called
# This will require all of the above plus defining a function using the keyword def and then calling that function, you do not need to pass the function any parameters




# Using the same program, modify it so you pass the user’s name to the function when called




# Modify the same program so you only write 'Happy Birthday to you' once





# Write a program that uses a function that takes two parameters to calculate the area of a rectangle.
# This will require that you use variables, input and print along with defining and calling a function




# Write a program that asks the user for a whole number greater than zero.
# If the number is less than 100 tell them that number is a small number, otherwise tell them that number is a large number.
# This will require using the keywords if and else






# Using that program, modify it so if the number is less than 10 tell them it is a single digit number,
# if it is less than 100 but at least 10 tell them that it is a double digit number,
# otherwise tell them that it is larger than a double digit number.
# This will require using the keywords if elif and else 







# Using a while loop, write a program that asks a user for a number.
# If the number is less than ten thousand, ask them to enter a larger number.
# Once they enter a number larger than ten thousand, end the loop and tell them the number is large enough.




# Write a program that is a number guessing game that counts the number of attempts it takes for a user to guess a number between 1 and 100.
# After every guess, tell the user if the number is too high or two low and let them keep guessing until they guess the right number
# Then let them know both that they are correct and how many attempts it took.
# This will require that you assign a number between 1 and 100 to a variable first for the user to guess and a variable to count the number of attempts.
