# Write a program that asks the user for a number greater than zero.
# When the number is less than 100 tell the user that their number is a small number, otherwise tell them that their number is a large number.


# Duplicate your previous work and modify it so that when the number is less than 10 tell them it is a single digit number,
# when the user's number is less than 100 but at least 10 tell them that it is a double digit number,
# otherwise tell them that it is larger than a double digit number.


# Using a while loop, write a program that asks a user for a number.
# When the number is less than ten thousand, ask them to enter a larger number.
# Once they enter a number larger than ten thousand, end the loop and tell them the number is large enough.


# Write a program that is a number guessing game that counts the number of attempts it takes for a user to guess a number between 1 and 100.
# After every guess, tell the user if the number is too high or two low and let them keep guessing until they guess the right number
# Then let them know both that they are correct and how many attempts it took.
# This will require that you assign a number between 1 and 100 to a variable first for the user to guess and a variable to count the number of attempts.
