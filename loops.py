# Using a while loop, write a program that asks a user for a number.
# ## If the number is less than ten thousand, ask them to enter a larger number.
# ## Once they enter a number larger than ten thousand, end the loop and tell them the number is large enough.

# Write a program that is a number guessing game that counts the number of attempts it takes for a user to guess a number between 1 and 100.
# ## After every guess, tell the user if the number is too high or two low and let them keep guessing until they guess the right number
# ## Then let them know both that they are correct and how many attempts it took.
# ## This will require that you assign a number between 1 and 100 to a variable first for the user to guess and a variable to count the number of attempts.

# create a calculator that can do multiple calculations
